Welcome to the Louisville seedbank Github~!

We are a partnership of various groups and individuals who reside in the Greater Kentuckiana area, and want to be able to make our neighborhoods self sufficient and find the best varieties of food to grow in our city!

Below are the goals of the seedbank.
